The problem statement is solved in 3 different files based upon the requirement. I don't want to put a lot in a single Jupiter notebook. So, I divided them into 3 files.

1. EDA.ipynb - This notebook has exploratory data analysis and feature engineering with the regression models at the end.

2. Dimensionality Reduction.ipynb - This notebook gives information on what attributes contribute to most of the data and which attributes are most important to do the feature selection.

3. Regression Models.ipynb - This notebook deals with regression models implementation and converting the results into .CSV files

rf_reg.csv - CSV from Random forest

xbg_reg.csv - CSV from XGBoost

linear_reg.csv - CSV from linear regression


Updated all the libraries before the analysis.
